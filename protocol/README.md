# Test Discovery Protocol

The Test Discovery Protocol establishes a common interface for passing
arguments to test runners, in order to make it easier for tools such as IDEs
and CI/CD systems to interact with test frameworks.

See [RFC 0001](./rfcs/0001/0001.md) for an explanation the protocol and the
motivation behind why it exists.

Changes to the protocol are made using the RFC process. All changes must have a
document written and posted as a pull request to be reviewed publicly before
being merged. RFCs act as both documentation and an archaeological record of
the changes made to the protocol, and serve as a way for all consumers of the
protocol to have a say in what changes get made.
